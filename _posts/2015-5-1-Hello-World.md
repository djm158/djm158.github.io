title: Hello World Post 
---

I decided decided to start a blog as a foray into the world of web development. I learn so much every day that if nothing else, this blog will at least serve to track my progress. Who knows, I have a good variety of interests and perhaps this post will be the catalyst for many blogs to come. It could also be a bust, but I figure it's worth a shot.  

I owe a lot of credit to [Barry Clark] (https://github.com/barryclark) and his [jekyll-now] (https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) project. I forked his project for the instant gratification of going from zero to blog post in about an hour. As I learn to work with [Jekyll] (http://jekyllrb.com/) I plan to tailor this blog to my liking, and hopefully learn some tricks along the way.
