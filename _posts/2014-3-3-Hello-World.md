title: Hello World Post 
---

I decided decided to start a blog as a foray into the world of web development. I learn so much every day that if nothing else, this blog will at least serve to track my progress. Who knows, I have a good variety of interests and perhaps this post will be the catalyst for many blogs to come. It could also be a bust, but I figure it's worth a shot.
