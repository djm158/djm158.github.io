title: On Being a Co-Op
---

Last semester, I was a software engineering co-op with a company based out of Ohio. During my rotation, I worked helped research new technologies to incorporate into my company's products, as well as created prototypes for new concepts. 

Being a co-op is an amazing learning experience. I realized very quickly how little practical experience I had really received so far in my two years studying computer engineering. Yes, I learned to code on a basic level. But I had yet to make anything meaningful. I had never developed a website, experimented with different operating systems, or create full-fledged applications. Version control? Where was that when I was cranking out my final projects via caffeine-fueled marathon code sessions. Learn git kids, you'll love it (except maybe if you're on windows I kind of hate it on windows). 

As amazing as my experience co-oping was, I did decide not to return to my company in the end. I had a great time, and they were amazing employers, but it mostly came down to location and proximity to my family and friends. I go to Pitt, and I've fallen in love with the city of Pittsburgh, so I definitely felt homesick living by myself in Ohio for four months. I'm optimistic about continuing with the co-op program at school however, and I'm excied for the opportunities to mature as an engineer.
