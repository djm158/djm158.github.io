Some information about me!

### About me

I have a lot of hobbies. When I'm not coding or building robots (I really want to build a robot), I like to run, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, play guitar, and listen to podcasts.

#### Podcasts

[Joe Rogan Experience] (http://podcasts.joerogan.net/)

[Programming Throwdown] (http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/)

[Waking Up] (http://www.samharris.org/podcast)

[Common Sense] (http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/)

[Hardcore History] (http://www.dancarlin.com/home-hh-54/)

[Serial] (http://serialpodcast.org/)

*Some of these podcasts are very political in nature. They are not necessarily representative of my political views, but they often present ideas and opinions which I had not previously considered, which I find very refreshing in today's political climate.
