Some information about you!

### About me

I have a lot of hobbies. When I'm not coding or building robots, I like to run, practice Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, play guitar, and listen to podcasts.

#### Podcasts
[Joe Rogan Experience] (http://podcasts.joerogan.net/)
[Programming Throwdown] (http://www.programmingthrowdown.com/)
[Waking Up] (http://www.samharris.org/podcast)
[Common Sense] (http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/)
[Hardcore History] (http://www.dancarlin.com/home-hh-54/)
[Serial] (http://serialpodcast.org/)

***Many of these podcasts are very political in nature. They are not necessarily representative of my political views, but they often present ideas and opinions which I had not previously considered, which is very refreshing in today's political climate.
